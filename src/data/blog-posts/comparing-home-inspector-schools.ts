## How to Compare Home Inspector Schools

When it comes to choosing a home inspection school, not all programs are created equal. The school you choose can significantly impact your chances of passing the licensing exam and launching a successful career.

### Key Factors to Consider

**1. Pass Rates**
The most important metric is the school's first-time pass rate. Texas is unique in that TREC publicly publishes pass rates for all approved providers. Always check the official TREC data before enrolling.

**2. Teaching Methodology**
Look for schools that use active learning techniques rather than passive video lectures. Adults learn best through engagement and practical application.

**3. Exam Preparation**
Does the school include comprehensive exam prep? Adaptive test preparation that targets your weak areas is far more effective than generic practice tests.

**4. Total Value**
Compare what's actually included in the price. Some schools charge extra for textbooks, exam prep, or software training that others include.

### Making Your Decision

Don't base your decision solely on price or brand recognition. The cost of failing the exam (retake fees, lost time, delayed career start) far outweighs any savings from choosing a cheaper but less effective school.

Research the official TREC pass rates, understand what's included, and choose the school that gives you the best chance of success.
