## Why Minimum Standards Aren't Enough

TREC sets basic standards for education providers, but meeting minimums doesn't guarantee student success. In fact, many schools that meet all TREC requirements still have pass rates well below 60%.

### What TREC Requires

TREC approval means a school has:
- Qualified instructors
- Approved curriculum content
- Proper administrative procedures
- Required course hours

### What TREC Doesn't Require

TREC approval doesn't guarantee:
- Effective teaching methodology
- Comprehensive exam preparation
- Student support and guidance
- Actual learning outcomes

### Going Beyond the Minimum

The best schools don't just meet requirements—they exceed them. This includes:

**Embedded Practice Questions**: Instead of saving all testing for the end, questions are integrated throughout the learning experience.

**Adaptive Exam Prep**: Technology that identifies weak areas and focuses study time where it's needed most.

**Multi-Language Support**: Making education accessible to all Texans, not just English speakers.

**Ongoing Support**: Guidance that continues until you pass your exam and launch your career.

### The Results Speak for Themselves

Schools that invest in effective teaching methodology consistently outperform those that do the minimum. When choosing a school, look beyond TREC approval to actual student outcomes.
