## Strategic NHIE Preparation

The National Home Inspector Examination (NHIE) covers an overwhelming amount of information. A strategic approach to preparation can make the difference between passing and failing.

### Understanding the NHIE

The NHIE is a 200-question, computer-based exam covering:
- Property and building inspection
- Analysis and reporting
- Professional practice

You have 4 hours to complete the exam and need a scaled score of 500 to pass.

### Common Preparation Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Passive Review**
Simply re-reading notes or watching videos again isn't effective. Active recall through practice questions is far more powerful.

**Mistake 2: Equal Time Allocation**
Don't spend equal time on every topic. Focus on your weak areas while maintaining strength in areas you know well.

**Mistake 3: Last-Minute Cramming**
Spaced repetition over time is more effective than intensive cramming. Start exam prep early and study consistently.

### Effective Preparation Strategies

**Use Adaptive Practice Tests**
The best exam prep systems identify your weak areas and focus your study time there. Don't waste time reviewing what you already know.

**Understand, Don't Memorize**
The NHIE tests understanding, not memorization. Focus on knowing WHY something is correct, not just WHAT is correct.

**Simulate Exam Conditions**
Take full-length practice exams under timed conditions. This builds stamina and reduces test-day anxiety.

**Know When You're Ready**
Aim to score consistently above 80% on practice exams before scheduling your real exam. This provides a comfortable margin.

### Test Day Tips

- Get good sleep the night before
- Arrive early and relax
- Read each question carefully
- Flag difficult questions and return to them
- Use all available time

With strategic preparation, you can walk into the NHIE confident and ready to pass.
