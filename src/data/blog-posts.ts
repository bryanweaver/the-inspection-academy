## Real Questions, Real Answers

![A student studying online with headphones, taking notes at a laptop](/images/blog/online-student-studying.jpg)

We recently received an email from a prospective student with three great questions. We loved the fact that he was doing his due diligence, and we think every prospective student should be asking the same questions before choosing a school. So, we decided to share our answers here.

## "You have a high pass rate but only 3 students have taken the exam. Why so few?"

Great question, and the answer is simple: we are brand new.

We started enrolling students in January of 2025. We did absolutely zero marketing that entire year. A handful of students found us through the TREC website and enrolled. Meanwhile, we waited for those early students to pass their exams so we could earn credit for helping them succeed.

Over the course of 2025, we only enrolled 23 students. Because each student enrolls at different times throughout the year, only 3 had completed their required courses and field experience in time to qualify for the exam. That is why we only had 3 students take their test over the first 13 months.

You also have to understand that most of our students are adults with full-time jobs, so they all have varying amounts of time to work on their courses. Some have more time than others. The Inspection Academy is not like an in-person course that has a finite amount of time until the courses are completed — start on Monday and end on Friday. Our students work at their own pace, which means the timeline to exam day varies from student to student.

### How We Turned a Setback Into a Breakthrough

Our first student to take the exam crushed the national exam but failed the Texas portion by just 1 question. That turned out to be both a blessing and a curse. It set us back several months, but it also catalyzed us to create our adaptive AI review app to help students review in the most efficient and effective manner once they have completed the 6 TREC-required courses.

By combining the two individual elements — our school and our review app — we have created a system that we believe prepares students to pass the test on their first attempt. In fact, we are so confident in the effectiveness of our system that we are offering a **full money-back guarantee**. If you take your courses through TIA, pass 5 full-length sample exams on our review app, and don't pass on your first attempt, we will refund every dime you spent on tuition.

### Why Getting In Now Matters

We are very young in this industry, having launched just last year with a vision to redefine educational excellence. From the beginning, our dedication to innovation and iteration has set us apart. We believe these values will make us a school worth watching as we grow and continue to help students succeed.

Right now, we are comparable in price to the schools that have been around for decades yet only pass 51% of their students on the first attempt — and that is the only test for which we have available data. TREC does not tell us how students fare on their second, third, and sometimes fourth attempts.

As we continue to help more students pass their exams on their first attempt, we will also be increasing the price of our courses. So, the time to get in is while we are still proving ourselves. You would be getting a discount rate on a premium product because you got in early.

## "Are your lessons structured as micro-readings?"

The simple answer is: yes.

We personally went through every single section and every single page of the books used to prepare students for the exam and broke it all down by sections. There is simply too much information to be covered in larger chunks. The best way to go through the course and hope to remember enough of the information is to take it bit by bit, then review and reinforce that information a multitude of times in different formats.

### How Our Courses Are Structured

The courses are set up with short **3-to-5-minute readings** followed by a **3-to-5-minute activity**. Activities include:

- Identification of systems and components
- Matching exercises
- Ordering exercises
- Multiple choice questions
- True or false questions
- Scenario-based activities

We tell every prospective student: **The Inspection Academy is not the fastest school to get through, and it is definitely not the easiest school to get through.**

### The Alternative

If fast and easy is what you are looking for, we would recommend doing an in-person course that starts on Monday at 8 AM and is completed on Friday at 5 PM. You will be done with your 40-hour course that fast and easy. In 4 weeks, you can be done with ALL of your courses.

![A confused student scratching his head while reading a textbook](/images/blog/confused-student.jpg)

Then it is ALL on you to figure out how to retain ALL of the information they presented to you while sitting in the classroom. There is zero time to reinforce any of the information in a class with that level of time constraints. There is simply too much information to get through to spend time focused on specific topics. You don't pay for reinforcement; you pay for the time they spend in the room with you and the information they can share about a 450-page book in 5 short days.

If you already have a thorough background in residential construction, that path might work. However, if you are starting from a beginner or novice level of understanding, that path is the fastest way to fail your test the first time, and likely more than once.

We get students calling us every week asking to purchase retake courses because after you fail the test 3 times, TREC requires you to take specific courses again. These people are paying between $300 to $1,800 to retake courses after they already paid thousands for the school they chose the first time. That is a damn shame, and it is the primary reason we built TIA.

## "Where do I get my ride-along inspections?"

Where you get your field experience depends on where you live.

TREC changed the "practicum" to "field experience." What that means is that it is no longer a required course that schools provide. It is now considered field experience that falls on the student to arrange.

### A Brief History

Because half of the schools approved to offer qualifying education in Texas are actually from out of state, they either could not provide the practicum or, if they did, it was sloppy. TREC allows schools to send 4 students with 1 inspector. Imagine how long it takes to move 4 students through the same attic.

When we started The Inspection Academy, we offered the practicum 7 days a week, 1-on-1, and we charged $1,000 for the 5 ride-alongs. Our students could complete their experiences in one week. However, when TREC removed the practicum from being a course, we stopped offering it because our ultimate goal is to help students pass their exam on their first attempt, and we do not believe the field experience contributes to that goal.

### Your Options Today

With the change from practicum to field experience, your options have increased:

- **School-offered practicum**: You can pay for one of the schools that still offer the practicum as a course and join their waitlist. These are the 4-to-1 experiences, but they will help you check the boxes TREC requires.
- **Independent licensed inspectors**: You can find any licensed Professional Inspector in your area with a minimum of 5 years in the industry or over 200 inspections and ask them to provide ride-along experiences.
- **Multi-inspector firms**: Some firms provide the field experience for free because they use ride-alongs as a way to onboard new inspectors, then hire them as soon as they pass the exam.
- **Houston area**: If you are in the Houston area, we have a few inspectors that will take you out for $100 per ride-along.

While the field experience may be beneficial for preparing to perform inspections, it does not contribute to helping students pass their exams. It is really a formality TREC has decided is important. If you need our help arranging it, we will help you as much as we can.

## The Bottom Line

The Inspection Academy is definitely not for everyone. Anyone with a solid background in residential construction and all of the systems and components of a house could pursue a different school.

**Our school is built for students that do not have a strong background in those topics.** We built TIA to help the people who must go from a low level of overall knowledge to passing the exam on their first attempt. Make no mistake, that will take time and effort.

Alternatively, you can take your chances with the other schools. They might promise they can get you ready to pass the exam in 3 weeks, but they often fail to mention that 49% of their promises go unfulfilled.

We built the only home inspection school in the country that actually **teaches** students, while the other schools drop all the information on students and put the onus on them to figure out how to retain it. That is not teaching.

TIA stands out for its comprehensive curriculum and personalized approach, as demonstrated by our early high student success rates. Our review app is a game-changer, leveraging AI to analyze each student's strengths and weaknesses through full-length sample exams. Unlike other review apps, our platform not only identifies knowledge gaps but also creates a dynamic study plan that evolves as students progress through the program.

**Our recommendation: Do not be one of those students calling The Inspection Academy for help after failing the test 3 times.**

If you have questions, do not hesitate to reach out. We are more than happy to help you make the best decision, even if it is not The Inspection Academy. Keep doing your research — you are doing the right thing.

## How to Compare Home Inspector Schools

When it comes to choosing a home inspection school, not all programs are created equal. The school you choose can significantly impact your chances of passing the licensing exam and launching a successful career.

### Key Factors to Consider

**1. Pass Rates**
The most important metric is the school's first-time pass rate. Texas is unique in that TREC publicly publishes pass rates for all approved providers. Always check the official TREC data before enrolling.

**2. Teaching Methodology**
Look for schools that use active learning techniques rather than passive video lectures. Adults learn best through engagement and practical application.

**3. Exam Preparation**
Does the school include comprehensive exam prep? Adaptive test preparation that targets your weak areas is far more effective than generic practice tests.

**4. Total Value**
Compare what's actually included in the price. Some schools charge extra for textbooks, exam prep, or software training that others include.

### Making Your Decision

Don't base your decision solely on price or brand recognition. The cost of failing the exam (retake fees, lost time, delayed career start) far outweighs any savings from choosing a cheaper but less effective school.

Research the official TREC pass rates, understand what's included, and choose the school that gives you the best chance of success.

    title: 'The Truth About Traditional Home Inspector Education',
    excerpt: 'Traditional Texas home inspector education is broken. Too often, it fails to prepare students for the rigorous licensing exam.',
    content: `
## Why Traditional Training Falls Short

Traditional Texas home inspector education is broken. Too often, it fails to prepare students for the rigorous licensing exam, leaving aspiring inspectors frustrated and their career dreams delayed.

### The Problem with Passive Learning

Most traditional schools rely on:
- Long video lectures that don't engage learners
- Thick textbooks with minimal guidance
- Generic quizzes that don't adapt to individual needs
- Rushed classroom sessions that prioritize completion over comprehension

Research in Adult Learning Theory has consistently shown that passive learning methods lead to poor retention. Adults don't learn well by sitting and listening—they need active engagement.

### The Statistics Tell the Story

The average pass rate for Texas home inspector schools is only 58.79%. That means more than 4 in 10 students fail their first exam attempt.

This isn't because the students aren't capable. It's because the training didn't prepare them effectively.

### A Better Approach

Effective training should:
- Use active learning with embedded practice questions
- Adapt to each student's strengths and weaknesses
- Connect concepts to real-world inspection scenarios
- Provide comprehensive, targeted exam preparation

The good news is that better options exist. Schools built on proven educational principles consistently achieve higher pass rates.

    excerpt: "TREC sets basic standards for education providers, but meeting minimums doesn't guarantee student success. Here's why we go further.",
    content: `
## Why Minimum Standards Aren't Enough

TREC sets basic standards for education providers, but meeting minimums doesn't guarantee student success. In fact, many schools that meet all TREC requirements still have pass rates well below 60%.

### What TREC Requires

TREC approval means a school has:
- Qualified instructors
- Approved curriculum content
- Proper administrative procedures
- Required course hours

### What TREC Doesn't Require

TREC approval doesn't guarantee:
- Effective teaching methodology
- Comprehensive exam preparation
- Student support and guidance
- Actual learning outcomes

### Going Beyond the Minimum

The best schools don't just meet requirements—they exceed them. This includes:

**Embedded Practice Questions**: Instead of saving all testing for the end, questions are integrated throughout the learning experience.

**Adaptive Exam Prep**: Technology that identifies weak areas and focuses study time where it's needed most.

**Multi-Language Support**: Making education accessible to all Texans, not just English speakers.

**Ongoing Support**: Guidance that continues until you pass your exam and launch your career.

### The Results Speak for Themselves

Schools that invest in effective teaching methodology consistently outperform those that do the minimum. When choosing a school, look beyond TREC approval to actual student outcomes.

    content: `
## The Science of Adult Learning

Research shows that adults learn differently than children. Understanding these differences is key to creating effective training programs.

### Key Principles of Adult Learning Theory

**1. Self-Direction**
Adults are self-directed learners. They want control over their learning pace and path. Self-paced online courses respect this need better than rigid classroom schedules.

**2. Experience-Based Learning**
Adults learn best when new information connects to their existing experience. Effective training uses real-world scenarios and practical examples.

**3. Immediate Application**
Adults are motivated by learning they can apply immediately. Training should focus on practical skills, not abstract theory.

**4. Problem-Centered Approach**
Adults prefer learning that solves real problems. Content should be organized around challenges they'll face as inspectors, not academic categories.

### How This Applies to Inspector Training

Traditional inspector training often ignores these principles:
- Lengthy lectures don't allow self-direction
- Abstract content doesn't connect to experience
- Theory-heavy curricula delay practical application
- Subject-organized content doesn't mirror real inspection challenges

### A Better Approach

Training designed with Adult Learning Theory includes:
- Interactive content with frequent engagement
- Real inspection scenarios and examples
- Practical skills integrated with theory
- Problem-based organization

### The Results

Schools using Adult Learning Theory principles consistently achieve higher pass rates. Students don't just memorize information—they actually learn it.

## Strategic NHIE Preparation

The National Home Inspector Examination (NHIE) covers an overwhelming amount of information. A strategic approach to preparation can make the difference between passing and failing.

### Understanding the NHIE

The NHIE is a 200-question, computer-based exam covering:
- Property and building inspection
- Analysis and reporting
- Professional practice

You have 4 hours to complete the exam and need a scaled score of 500 to pass.

### Common Preparation Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Passive Review**
Simply re-reading notes or watching videos again isn't effective. Active recall through practice questions is far more powerful.

**Mistake 2: Equal Time Allocation**
Don't spend equal time on every topic. Focus on your weak areas while maintaining strength in areas you know well.

**Mistake 3: Last-Minute Cramming**
Spaced repetition over time is more effective than intensive cramming. Start exam prep early and study consistently.

### Effective Preparation Strategies

**Use Adaptive Practice Tests**
The best exam prep systems identify your weak areas and focus your study time there. Don't waste time reviewing what you already know.

**Understand, Don't Memorize**
The NHIE tests understanding, not memorization. Focus on knowing WHY something is correct, not just WHAT is correct.

**Simulate Exam Conditions**
Take full-length practice exams under timed conditions. This builds stamina and reduces test-day anxiety.

**Know When You're Ready**
Aim to score consistently above 80% on practice exams before scheduling your real exam. This provides a comfortable margin.

### Test Day Tips

- Get good sleep the night before
- Arrive early and relax
- Read each question carefully
- Flag difficult questions and return to them
- Use all available time

With strategic preparation, you can walk into the NHIE confident and ready to pass.
